# How to become a Senior Web Developer

## Introduction

I'm trying to build a list of topics, technologies, or anything I need to become a *Senior Web Developer*. I want this list to not only helping me but anyone (actually any Web Developer) to become a Senior. **I know** that just knowing the following things is not enough, and we all need a big amount of years of work experience. **I also know** that this list could vary depends on the specific language or web development branch we choose.

For those (as me) living in Latin America without a fluent spoken **English**, well.. that **is another must**!

## How to contribute - Please do it!

Give your opinion [**here**](https://github.com/abelosorio/how-to-become-a-senior-web-developer/issues/1). I think we could build a helpful list for anyone. Whatever language or technologies you use, we all need to know the basics, and that is what this list is. The basis, or the general topics we all need to know. And to know it very well.

# The list

## Basics

  * Algorithm design techniques
  * Calculation of complexity (Big-O notation)

## Programming paradigms

### Functional programming

### Logic programming

### Object oriented

  * Design patterns
  * SOLID
  * DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
  * Duck typing

## Databases

### Relational

Yes, there are a lot of good ORMs and we should use them but a basic acknowledgment of these technologies is very important as well.

  * Basic SQL understanding.
  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQLite

### Non-relational

  * MongoDB
  * Memcache
  * Casandra
  * Redis
  
## Agile

  * SCRUM
  * XP
  * Kanban

## Architectural patterns

### MVC (Model-view-controller)

### Front controller

### Active Record

## Testing

### Testing levels (Unit, Integration, etc)
### Testing types (Regression, Acceptance, Alpha, etc)

## Software development techniques

  * TDD (Test-Driven development)
  * BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
  * ATDD (Acceptance-Test-Driven Development)

## Non-technical skills

### Communication with both Clients and other developers (or team members)
