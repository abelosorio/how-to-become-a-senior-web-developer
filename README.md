# How to become a Senior Web Developer

## Introduction

I'm trying to build a list of topics, technologies, or anything I need to become a *Senior Web Developer*. I want this list not only helping me but anyone (actually any Web Developer) to become a Senior. **I know** that just knowing the following things is not enough, and we all need a big amount of years of work experience. **I also know** that this list could vary depends on the specific language or web development branch we choose.

For those (as me) living in Latin America without a fluent spoken English, well.. that is a must!

## How to contribute - Please do it!

Give your opinion [**here**](https://github.com/abelosorio/how-to-become-a-senior-web-developer/issues/1). I think we could build a helpful list for anyone. Whatever language or technologies you use, we all need to know the basics, and that is what this list is. The basis, or the general topics we all need to know. And to know it very well.
